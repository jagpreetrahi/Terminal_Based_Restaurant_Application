This repository contains a terminal-based restaurant application developed to deepen the understanding of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.
The application is structured into three main phases:

Menu: This phase allows users to browse the restaurant's offerings, including food and drink options, along with their  prices.

Order: In this phase, users can select items from the menu to place an order. The application handles the logic for adding items to the order, calculating the total cost, and making any necessary adjustments.

Table: This phase manages table assignments and tracks the status of orders for each table. It ensures smooth operations within the restaurant by organizing customer orders based on their assigned tables.
